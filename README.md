# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

The current project contains 3 files:


1) An R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each        subject.
    
2) A Code Book file  that describes the variables of the run_analysis script

3) A file returned by the run_analysis script named tidyDataSet
